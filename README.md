## Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Goal: To recognize handwritten digits from MNIST dataset using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and ResNet5

***Dataset*** : MNIST

***Architecture*** : ResNet5 

***Loss function*** : ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43094149/164942866-4f499de2-97c8-48f4-a59f-99b631f2059e.png)

***No. of epochs*** : 150

***Short description*** : A ResNet architecture has skip connections between each pair of layers. ResNet5 architecture is implemented. The architecture is implemented from scratch using the Keras functional model.
